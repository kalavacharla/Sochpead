1. Logo
	Logo needs to be fresh and airy. I would like the idea of having an image and fairly plain text.
	Logo should have transparent background so that I can put it in any web color scheme.
	Logo can also be made of pictures which will spell out the name.
	
NOTE: If logo is good enough, check out if they can do a color scheme for us.
